									<h2>First day </h2>
									<p>I was entering in to a new world with millions of dreams rolling in my head </p>
								</header>
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<p>It was my first day and my cupboard was a complete mess,I was literrally frustrated in choosing my dress . Atlast I choosed one. And now its time to open a new page of my life. I saw a big crowd sitting infront of a welcome stage, I joined them with my parents. After a big boring lecture, my parents left and I was all alone in a strangers world. On my way to LH-47, I was attracted by a group a ducks playing,trees dancing with joy and birds singing the welcome song. I felt like walking into a heaven of nature.</p>
								<p>I reached my classroom, and I knew I was the last one to enter. A group was well settled at the back and was screaming loudly, suddenly they burst in to laughter as I entered, and yes I was jealous. I went and shared my bench with another girl who was all alone. Even she was with the same mental disorder, we were well set less than a hour. Here comes the twist a mam entered and started the class bla bla. And all of a sudden the marriage hall turned into a underworld. </p>
								<p>Life is full of Strange experience <b>good and bad,happy and sad</b>. Some of these are unforgettable.</p>
